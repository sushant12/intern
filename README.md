Awards.csv contracts.csv and final.csv files are the required files. Final.csv is empty at the begining but after you run the new.php file, it will get populated with awards.csv and contracts.csv data.

First clone the repo to your htdocs then point the url in the browser to the cloned dir then run the new.php.
